# BlueMap Offline Players Marker for forge 1.20.1
Thanks to TechnicJell for publishing the source code of the mod on github, which allowed me to port it to forge for my own server\
See https://github.com/TechnicJelle/BlueMapOfflinePlayerMarkers/tree/main for the original source code

# BlueMapOfflinePlayerMarkersForge
A ported version of the TechnicJelle's BlueMap Offline Player Markers mod (1.20.1) that was in my files for quite some times. I hope it can help the author to port it to forge, as I've seen it is in his TODO list
