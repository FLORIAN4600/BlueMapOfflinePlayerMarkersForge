# BlueMap Offline Players Marker for forge and neoforge
Thanks to TechnicJell for publishing the source code of the mod on GitHub, which allowed me to port it to forge for my own server\
A huge thanks to syorito-hatsuki without whom I would have not been able to do this port, as I based myself on his Fabric source code\
And my thankings again to TechnicJelle, as my mod contains part of BMUtils code
- See https://github.com/TechnicJelle/BlueMapOfflinePlayerMarkers/tree/main for the original source code
- See https://github.com/syorito-hatsuki/BlueMapOfflinePlayerMarkersFabric for the Fabric source code
- See https://github.com/TechnicJelle/BMUtils/tree/main for the BMUtils source code

## Is this mod a port or a fork
**As of today, This mod has left his port state and is now a fork, as it has a divergence of content compared to the original plugin.**\
*But, I do try to include all the original plugin content and new features in my mod.*<br><br>
**This fork differs in:**
- Ability to select if banned player markers are hidden, destroyed or kept
- Ability to fake offline player markers via ``/fakeOfflineMaker <name> [<pos>] [<uuid>]``
- Ability to delete offline player markers via ``/deleteOfflineMarker <name>``

## Will this mod be updated?
**I will try to keep it updated. Maybe for a year or two.**\
<br>
If it has not been updated for over a month, and that you are interested in either me porting the mod, or you taking the lead on ports, feel free to leave an [Issue](https://github.com/FLORIAN4600/BlueMapOfflinePlayerMarkersForge/issues) or a [Pull Request](https://github.com/FLORIAN4600/BlueMapOfflinePlayerMarkersForge/pulls).\
<br>
Do feel free to update or fork or modify it to your needs (be aware that the [**license**](https://github.com/FLORIAN4600/BlueMapOfflinePlayerMarkersForge/blob/main/LICENSE) requires you to do things like: credit the publishers of the source code (TechnicJell, syorito-hatsuki and FLORIAN4600), put a link to their original code, and copy the license as it was provided by the first repo).
