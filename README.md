# BlueMap Offline Players Marker for forge 1.20.1
Thanks to TechnicJell for publishing the source code of the mod on github, which allowed me to port it to forge for my own server\
A huge thanks to syorito-hatsuki without whom I would have not been able to do this port, as I based myself on his Fabric source code\ 
See https://github.com/TechnicJelle/BlueMapOfflinePlayerMarkers/tree/main for the original source code\
See https://github.com/syorito-hatsuki/BlueMapOfflinePlayerMarkersFabric for the Fabric source code

# BlueMapOfflinePlayerMarkersForge
A ported version of the TechnicJelle's BlueMap Offline Player Markers mod (1.20.1) that was in my files for quite some time.\
I hope it can help the author to port it to forge, as I've seen it was one of the things in his TODO list

## Will this mod be updated?
It depends on my needs\
I actually use to port mods from one version of Minecraft to another or from fabric to forge / from forge to fabric\
But I only do this to small mods when I need to\
So this mods might go on without updates or with updates, it will depend on my needs and my schedule\
But as this mod seems really simple to maintain, I will try my best to keep it updated, at least for 1-2 years\
Do feel free to update or fork or modify it to your needs (be aware that the [**license**](https://github.com/FLORIAN4600/BlueMapOfflinePlayerMarkersForge/blob/main/LICENSE) requires you to credit as I did the authors + put a link to their code & use the same licensing).
